###http://primo.io

Created on Apr 2015 by Matteo Loglio

Use this library to program Cubetto robot from the Arduino IDE.

###Installation:

The Cubetto library requires the "AccelStepper" library to run, which is included in "libraries.zip": after unzipping the file, copy the "AccelStepper" folder inside your Arduino "libraries" folder, usually located in your sketchbook folder.

**Remember to include the "AccelStepper" library, together with the "Cubetto" one**

If you want to know how to install this library, check out this tutorial on the Arduino website:

###Usage:

Check out the **basic** example, under **File/Examples/Cubetto/Basics** to get started. 
A full description of all the functions is coming soon.
